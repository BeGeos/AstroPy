# AstroPy

An API for astronomy enthusiasts. The logic behind it is quite straightforward. Just type in the query URL a name of a constellation and you receive a JSON response 
with the most significant and important information about said constellation, namely:
- Right Ascension and Declination, essential for observation
- Minimium and Maximum Latitude where that constellation can be seen
- The main stars that comprise the constellation
